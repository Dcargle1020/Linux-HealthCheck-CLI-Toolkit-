## 🔍 Commands Run
- `free -h`
- `vmstat 1 5`
- `top` (Shift + M to sort by memory)
- `ps aux --sort=-%mem`
- `pmap -x [PID]`
- `smem` (if available)

## 📈 Observations
- Memory usage is within acceptable range.
- No excessive swap usage detected.
- No runaway memory processes found.

## 📁 Per-Process Memory Review
- Top memory-consuming processes were identified using `top` and `ps`.

## 🛠️ Actions Taken
- Restarted heavy memory-using service(s) as a test (if applicable).
- Checked for memory leaks via `pmap` and `smem`.

## ✅ Summary
